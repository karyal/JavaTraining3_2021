Object Oriented Programming Approach (Methodology)
1. Class (Encapsulation)
	- Class as Container
	- Instance variables
	- this
	- Constructor (Default, Parameterized, and Copy)
	- Overloading - Class have same name of multiple methods with different parameter list
	- Setters and Getters
	- toString
 
2. Inheritance (extends)
	- extends
	- super
	- Overriding (@Overriding) - parent and child class have same name but different body (code)

3. Polymorphism 
	-  Overloading - Class have same name of multiple methods with different parameter list
	-  Overriding (@Overriding) - parent and child class have same name

4. Abstraction *
	- Abstract Class/abstract method - must extends
	- Interface (final variable/abstract method) - must implements

5. Others
	- final class - can not extend
	- abstract class - must extend

6. Package
	- Create
	- Export as jar file
	- Import jar file

7. Access Specifier (within a package/outside of package)
	- Default
	- public
	- private
	- protected

8. Inner Class
	- Class within class
	- Outer Class
	- Inner Class
