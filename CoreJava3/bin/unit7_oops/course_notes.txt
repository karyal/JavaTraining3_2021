Object Oriented Programming Approach (Methodology)
1. Class & Object
- Class
- Object
- Instance variables
- this
- Constructor (Default, Parameterized, and Copy)
- Overloading - Class have same name of multiple methods with different parameter list
- Setters and Getters
- toString
 
2. Inheritance (extends)
- extends
- super
- Overriding (@Overriding) - parent and child class have same name but different body (code)

3. Polymorphism 
-  Overloading - Class have same name of multiple methods with different parameter list
-  Overriding (@Overriding) - parent and child class have same name

4. Abstraction *
- Abstract Class/abstract method - must extends
- Interface (final variable/abstract method) - must implements

5. Others
- final class - can not extend
- abstract class - must extend

6. Package
- Create
- Export as jar file
- Import jar file
